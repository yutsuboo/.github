# Our Pixel Art Game

## Overview
Welcome to the public repository for our Medieval Pixel Art Game project! In this document, we'll provide a brief overview of our project's goals, style, and progress.

## Project Description
Our project revolves around the creation of a pixel art-based game with a Medieval art style. We aim to infuse elements of nature and mysticism into our game to transport players into a visually enchanting world. Below are some key aspects of our project:

### Art Style
We've settled on a Medieval art style, which will be prominently featured in the game. This aesthetic will combine the charm of the Medieval era with modern elements to create a unique visual experience.

### Setting
Our game is set in a thriving village located in the heart of a mystical forest, situated on a flat floating island. The village is divided into two main sections connected by numerous bridges. Despite its Medieval appearance, the village incorporates modern elements, such as shops, a cafe, a library, an alchemy workshop, and various NPCs living within the trees. The village streets are adorned with inviting street lamps, casting a warm glow. The surrounding forest is teeming with mystical creatures, glowing plants, mushroom groves, scattered ruins, caverns with giant crystals, and various types of unique vegetation. The forest's towering trees create pockets of eternal darkness, accessible only with exceptionally bright lanterns.

## Project Progress
We have just started so there is not much so say here except our visual concept.

### Next Steps
We are currently thinking of a capturing story.
